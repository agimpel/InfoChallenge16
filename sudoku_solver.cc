// For a blank cell, find a number that is not present in the same row, column and box.                                                                                                                        //

// If for any blank cell, there are no possible numbers to be filled in, reconsider the previous cell that was filled (-> backtrack).                                                                          //

// *Use of 'char' as main data type for numbers, as 1 byte is sufficent                                                                                                                                        //
// *Use of only one-dimensional arrays as well as pointers                                                                                                                                                     //
// *Use of both 'stationary' and 'relative' pointers to reduce the amount of addition and multiplication necessary to produce the correct offset to an array                                                   //
// *While reading the input grid from file, the row, column and box of each cell is precalculated, the position (=offset, row, column & box) of every blank and the numbers already in use are saved           //
// *With the precalculated offsets, row, column and box, no cell information has to be calculated prior to evaluation of possible numbers                                                                      //
// *Instead of recollecting the numbers within row, column and box every time a cell is considered, the numbers in use for every row, column and box are kept track of                                         //
// *Quite a few small optimizations to preliminary calculation of offsets, loop conditions and value consideration for blank cells                                                                             //

/* LOG OF OPTIMIZATION
readings based on this worst-case sudoku and without any optimization flags:
000000010000002003000400000000000500401600000007100000050000200000080040030910000

0m51.620s	base reading

1m10.074s	check order: box, col, row

0m56.600s	check order: box, row, col

0m53.362s	check order: row, col, box

0m43.493s	move col, row_m and box calculations from function to main
		//doing the same thing 9 times over at worst is indeed unnecessary

0m34.340s	reworked conditions for duplicate while loop and following if, save one additional loop over all conditions
		//apparently, one additional loop = 1/4 extra time

0m33.300s	define col, row_m and box as global variables to prevent overhead by passing variables
		//interestingly does not change much

0m32.536s	move relocation of rel_sudoku to if-cases, prevent extra assignment per loop

0m30.394s	reworked evaluation of current cell to not test within array, instead uses global variable value
		//not a big improvement

0m26.683s	box-check: remove modulo operation and use if cases
		//quite significant difference

0m20.375s	row-check: use if cases instead of for-loop
		//and someone said assignments were cheap

0m16.750s	col-check: use if cases instead of for-loop
		//well

0m15.776s	move assignment of row, column and box pointers from function to main
		//same thing performed at worst 9 times over is also unnecessary here

0m12.853s	instead of comparing each new value of dowhile-loop to all row/column/box elements again, gather all existing values first and instead compare against that collection
		//kind of self-evident

0m10.187s	row, column and box of each blank cell is now calculated upon reading the cell from file (this info obviously doesn't change), instead of each time anew upon consideration of a blank cell
		//interesting how such a detail accounts for about 1/4 of computation time

0m8.986s	instead of collecting the existing values each time a new blank is considered, keep track of them for every row, column and box
		//impact not as big as expected, introduced a lot of new assignments

0m8.190s	instead of pointing to two-dimensional arrays for storing existing values for each row, column and box, use one-dimensional arrays with offset
		//that one exam exercise pays off

0m7.636s	store row, column and box number as multiple of 12 to remove additional operations from while loop, data type changed to unsigned short int

0m7.541s	instead of storing row, column and box information as well as empty cells as char, change data type to unsigned short int
		//maybe prevents implicit casts to int upon use for offsets (?)

0m7.326s	in output to terminal, use '\n' instead of endl to prevent the expensive emptying of the buffer

0m7.013s	precalculate relative position of pointers to row, column and box outside of dowhile-loop to save three additions per loop iteration

0m6.782s	if a blank is succesfully filled, the next blank's value has to be 0. So it is unnecessary to read 0 from the array
                //this fact was even described in that line's comment

0m6.499s	reworked conditions of dowhile loop once more; saves one loop if terminating due to not finding a possible value to fill in

0m6.213s	reworked logic for evaluation of duplicates. By use of AND instead of OR, short-circuit property prevents further evaluation if number is already used in a previous test case

0m6.192s	arrays containing the existence information of numbers for every row, column and box are now type bool

0m6.116s	invert pointer update ifclause to prevent additional negation
